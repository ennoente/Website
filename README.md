##### This project does not only include building my personal website where I can showcase myself. It is also a great reason and way to learn ReactJS, as it poweres the websites frontend.
##### Let's see where our journey takes us!

#### Frontend
ReactJS: Website is divided into components. Over the course of its development, the components will be listed here as said list grows.
Components at this time include:

- ProfilePic - Profile picture in the upper left corner


#### Backend
Even-though this project, having been installed and initialized with create-react-app, runs on a NodeJS server in development mode, once in production a Spring backend takes
responsibility as webserver.
