# My Personal Website

#### This project does not only include building my personal website where I showcase myself. It is also a great reason and way to learn ReactJS, as it poweres the websites frontend.
#### Let's see where our journey takes us!

### Frontend
ReactJS: Website is divided into components. Over the course of its development, the components will be listed here as said list grows.
Components at this time include:

- ProfilePic - Profile picture in the upper left corner
- Profile - Quick profile who I am and what I do
- MainArticle - Introductory text about myself and my projects (not quite sure what to put in at this point, tbh...)


### Backend
Even-though this project, having been installed and initialized with create-react-app, runs on a NodeJS server in development mode, once in production a Spring backend takes
responsibility as webserver.
