        <p><br/>
            I have loved programming since I was 13 years old.
            Having started with Java in 2011, which is still my favourite
            programming language in the world, I have been and stil am
            improving my programming and software development skills every
            day.

            <br/> <br/>

            Studying to become a primary school teacher, I know what it takes
            to professionally develop software.
