            <h4>I am more than just a programmer</h4>

            I have loved programming since I was 13 years old.
            Having started with Java in 2011, which is still my favourite
            programming language in the world, I have been and still am
            improving my programming and software development skills every
            day.

            <h4>I learn by doing projects</h4>

            I have yet to attend a 'coding boot camp' or any course that teaches
            programming. I have always learned what I know by solving problems or creating
            something that fascinates and amazes me. "Can I actually build this?"
            is my best motivator. I love exploring my opportunities, trying out new technologies
            and creating software that other people can use and enjoy.

            <h4>I am a team player</h4>

            Studying to become a primary school teacher, I love teaming
            up and solving problems together. I don't need to be a computer
            scientist to know what it takes to professionally develop software.
