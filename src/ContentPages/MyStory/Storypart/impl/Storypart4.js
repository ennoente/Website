            I do an internship at a local E-Commerce company. Being in the IT branch I am introduced to Qt and its language, QML. Being the nerd I am, I program Monopoly another time, this time with Qt/QML.
            <br/>
            During that time, I come across Necessitas, a Qt port for Android. This idea fascinates me. To this point, I have never thought about my software being seriously used by other people. Iâ€™ve just loved experimenting with code and maybe showing it to friends. But making an app that other people, strangers from the Internet, could install and use? That would be awesome!
